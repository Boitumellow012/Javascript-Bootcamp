### 1. **Number Line Jumps**

#### Problem:
Two kangaroos start at different positions and jump at different distances. The goal is to determine if they will land at the same position after the same number of jumps. The task is to return "YES" if they meet or "NO" if they do not.

---

### 2. **Sales by Match**

#### Problem:
You are given an array of integers where each integer represents the color of a sock in a pile. The goal is to determine how many pairs of socks have the same color. You need to count the number of matching pairs and return that number.

---

### 3. **Bill Division**

#### Problem:
Two friends, Anna and Brian, are sharing a bill at a restaurant. Anna declines to eat one of the items, and Brian calculates the amount Anna should pay. The task is to determine if Brian calculated Anna's portion correctly. If the calculation is correct, print "Bon Appetit". If Anna was overcharged, print the amount Brian must refund.

## Exercises

### 1. **Temperature Check**

#### Description:
This exercise involves checking the current temperature and determining whether it's freezing, cold, mild, or warm based on the given temperature range.

---

### 2. **Divisibility Check**

#### Description:
In this exercise, you will check if a given number is divisible by 2, 3, or both. You will print the appropriate message based on the divisibility conditions.

---

### 3. **For Loops**

#### Description:
This exercise focuses on using a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers. You will print numbers in a specific range, sum them, and even find the largest number in an array using loops.

---

### 4. **While Loops**

#### Description:
The exercise involves using a `while` loop to iterate until a condition is met. You will practice summing numbers, printing multiples of a number, and other tasks using the `while` loop.

---

### 5. **Do While Loops**

#### Description:
This exercise focuses on using a `do-while` loop, where the condition is checked after the loop body is executed. You will practice running loops that execute at least once, even if the condition is not initially true.

## Conclusion

These challenges and exercises help practice basic JavaScript concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations. They are great for improving problem-solving skills.
